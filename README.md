# Save-Disaster
This repo is for code-fun-do challenge

## Basic Idea - 
During the relief one of the biggest challenge is the allocation of resources effectively across the country so that we can reach out to as many sections of the population as possible. During relief its really difficult to manage as even though we may get lot of well wishers donations through various channels, a lot of time is wasted in allocating them.

Taking cue from the Kerala Relief operation, what at the moment we need is a centralized mode where multiple agencies and individuals can communicate while leading the relief operation.

## Whats new - 
Even though multiple organizations open up their own donation portal, this is not a simple donation portal. What we want is the effective allocation and management of the relief resources. The key here is effective organization. Our users will not be the people in distress but rather the managers of these people. Time management and resource allocation are 2 key points here and this app would help various organizations in doing that. However, the people in distress will be able to view nearest First Aid stations and Releif Centres.

## Features -

- Identifying the areas. 
  The news currently can give us a very broad idea about locations in distress, say Mumbai or Kerala in distress. however, all people may not need help or some sections would require more help than the rest. In order to tackle that, our app will use facebook's mark myself safe feature which can give us an idea about locations which are relatively safe. These locations can be used as relief camps as well.

Secondly, a lot of people want to help out but there is no means to do it. During such times we can have a centralized portal where all NGOS can add up their entire donations aand this can be effectively allocated to the locations based in the danger level and number of people present.This will save a lot of time and will not involve wastage of donations.

Another way we can use it, it can connect to nearest wholesale providers who are able to help, so resources procured from them like grains etc can be effectively distributed.

The app will also have a channel through which multiple NGOs can communicate and collaborate along with people like you and me so that we dont miss out just because we didnt have the means to help out.

The Kerala website was a stop gap solution which streamlined the process and we believe it to be a corner stone as it showed how effective communication goes a long way in mitigating disaster.
